## FakeMario

Is a Unity based game built in a 3d enivornment but is played as a 2d platformer. In this game you will encounter enemies, moving projectiles and damaging terrain. Lucky for you that you have 3 lives to work with. On your way to the end of the level you will be able to collect coins and keep track of your score. Also there will be powerups that you can pickup and make you more powerful. 
### Controls

The Controls are rather simple:

```markdown
You will be using "WASD" for moving around. Spacebar to jump and the "C" key to crouch

```
